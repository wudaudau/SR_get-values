# SR_get-values
to get certain values from txt files

- There are many txt files.
- We want to get certain values from each file: 1) name and 2) value.
- In the ipynb file, I already set the process to get what we need from the txt. The final result is a Python dictionary: {"name": value}

2. Upload txt files in to the `files` folder
3. Open the `.ipynb` and run all the cells
